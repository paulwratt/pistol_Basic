# NietCiv Spoilers
This directory contains much information about "you" and "your relationship" to the world in which you find "your self".

WARNING: These spoilers can cause a lack of interest in NietCiv, due to the fact that the games depth depends entirely on you as the "player". You dont need to know anything in these files to "win" the game. Just know that you can play a 5 minute game or a 2000 hour game, its up to you.  You have been warned.

## Details
There is a lot, and I mean _A_ _LOT_, of "what if's" and "possibilities" in NietCiv, and they often have inter-relationships to other things. To help those who want to know more, especially backstories or references, but dont feel the need to know everything in one go, the spoilers are broken up into parts:

- places
- guilds
- characters
- achievements
- scoring

Each one is then split according to a negative or positive balance. Some content has a locale specific origin, for example, if you want to know about _Horse_ and _Dog_, you need to watch the _Footrot_ _Flats:_ _The_ _Movie_. If you want to know more about _Dog_ and his relationship to _Horse_, you need to read the cartoon strips, specifically the ones about Dog and Horse (there are a couple that pertain to the backstories used here).

Unfortunately even the spoilers contain a lot of "may" or "may not", and just about everything is optioned, but that is because NietCiv generates game content at interaction time, which allows it to build varied and diversified timelines according to what you are doing, based on the senario start point, and what has been recoreded previously. If you dont interact with something, it does not bother wasting time generating content. If you decide to interact with and "old something" later on, it will join the dots for you, thus allowing you to explore certain options required to achieve long term goals. Specifically those that fit into the 2000 hr bracket. But is also means you have a real chance of getting good or even great "scores" for any length of game. It all depends on how much time you have got, and what you feel like doing.

I hope you enjoy finding out about NietCiv possibilities, wheather you read the spoilers or not.

If you are desperate for a bit of an indicator of where a senario could end up, set DEBUG=1 at the end of LINE 10 and save the source. SHIFT-D dumps the city array, and SHIFT-C shows the character setup, the top line gives some map info.
