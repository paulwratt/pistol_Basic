# Klaxisaur Character

NOTE: if you have not figured anything out about a Klaxisaur senario then just read the description below, and try a few more different things again. If you do that, you will feel more confident about playing other non-Klaxisaur roles, especially if you want to figure out how to stay around for longer term goals.

Location: somewhere on "Earth", Earth Station

References: My Darling in a Franxx, anime series

Description: no two Klaxisaur are alike, or even similar, even in base color, a pale white or pale creame or pale grey. They have luminiscent blue veins that turn red when aggressive. They can transmutate into differnt shapes as required for their mission task. They can genetically modify other lifeforms with their own DNA. They can absorb tools into static positions on the body, the only limit is surface area. They tend to be quite logical and analytical, and mostly psychopathic  when not seen, unless the mission task requires a different outcome.




























































* NOT Earth Station Senarios:

- If you are Human you may be part Klaxisaur.
- If you are Ghosting you will probably be Aggressive.
- If you are Anti-Leader you will be Ghosting and Aggreesive.
- If you are part of the Anti-Klaxisaur Guild you may be Ghosting, 
  and therefore probably Aggressive.
- Your roll is determined by your Guild allegance, and where 
  Earth Station is. Mission tasks are usually Infiltrate, Subjugate, 
  Assimilate or Anihilate, but observation and patience may be enough.
- More than likely your primary goal may be to find Earth Station, and 
  if you are really lucky, you will get off this insane square, flat, 
  rock, that may have kept you here for a couple of million millenia, 
  unless you feel like Hibernating again, if you are Full Klaxisaur.
- For a more detailed insight, scroll down to the section required.
  Try not to look at the other sections.
- Part of the game is about figuring out the depth of the senario you 
  are playing, as once you do figure it out, it is much easier to do 
  long term goals in the other senarios.
- Full Klax Senarios are next, Human Senarios are last.




















































































* Full Klaxisaur Senarios

- Klax, no Wounds: If it looks like old ruins, you have probably been hibernating.
                   If there are Human and Klax body parts around, there was probably 
                   something bad happening while you were gone.
                   If there are only Klax body parts around, you have probably arrived 
                   too late to save anyone on the resupply ship.
- Klax, 1 Wounds: no body parts, you may have just passed out, or you may have just 
                   been "born", "again".

- Klax: Guild allegence tells you what your current mission task is at the moment. 
                   Look around for things you can salvage, deconstruct or repair. 
                   Anyone can use Klaxisaur gear if they can figure it out, or find 
                   the instructions.
- Klax: as full Klaxisaur, you can carry just about anything, and if you run out of 
                   room, you can always transmutate to make more room. However there 
                   may be side effects from that, and you might find yourself heading 
                   south quite a bit.
































































































* Earth Station Human-Klax Senarios:

NOTE: You wont know you are part Klax until you "find out", either by accident 
      or on purpopse.

- Human-Klax with no Wounds: You have probably just been "born". Look around.
- Human-Klax with 1 Wounds: no body parts, you probably cam back to regroup,
                            look around for supplies.
- Human-Klax with 2 Wounds: With Klax body parts around, you are probably the 
                            only survivor, but you need to know your Guild 
                            allegance to know what your mission task is.
- Human-Klax Ghost, no Wounds: You have probably just got back from a recon 
                            mission, unless you are Agrressive. Look around.
- Human-Klax Ghost, 1 Wounds: You may have just found the place again, or you 
                            may be trying to hide. Look around, use some logical 
                            thought ideas, your Guild allegance determines your 
                            mission task.
- Human-Klax Ghost, 2 Wounds: You may be the only one alive, especially if there 
                            are Klax body parts around. However you may have 
                            been chased back here, your Guild allegance will 
                            help figure things out.
- Human-Klax: anyone can use a Klaxisaur tool if they can figure it out, or 
                            understand the instructions. Same goes for reparing, 
                            creating and equiping items. You may be required 
                            as food for your cousins, please dont be upset.
- Human-Klax: sometimes the best way to figure something out is to assume nothing 
                            and try the simple things first.
